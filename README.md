# Udacity-Lab-Pixel-Art-Project
Using DOM selectors and event listeners to build a single page app that allows users to create their own pixel Art.

<strong>What is a Lab?</strong>
A Lab is an automatically graded assignment and is a graduation requirement.

In this Lab, you'll develop a grid of cells where you can create an amazing 8-bit pixel masterpiece. On the following page, you'll be able to launch your Lab. Inside the Lab, you'll be given instructions and a workspace where you can code your project.

When you're ready to see how you're doing, press the "Run Code" button! A panel will open to display the progress of the automatic grader. If one of the rules doesn't pass, make sure to read the grader's feedback carefully to see what needs to be changed.

<h1> Pixel Art Maker </h1>
You create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

To begin, you'll be given starter code (including HTML and CSS) to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
Choose a color.
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
